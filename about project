Features:
Add Expense: Adds a new expense by entering the category (e.g., Food, Entertainment) and the amount.

View Expenses: Displays all the expenses with their category and amount.

Delete Expense: Allows the user to delete an expense by selecting its number from the list.

How it works:
The program stores the expenses in an ArrayList<Expense>.

Each expense is represented by the Expense class, which has two fields: category and amount.

The ExpenseTracker class handles user input and provides a simple console-based interface for interaction.
